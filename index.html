    <h2>Mitigation of Biometric Data Misuse is the Key to Identity Theft Prevention​</h2>

            <h3>Defining the Topic</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In the area of digital security, great advances have been made in the design of identity theft, which involves illegally obtaining an indivuals’s personal details, such as credit cards numbers or social security information with the intention of impersonating them (Baecker, 2019).
                Thanks to developments in robotics, bionics, artificial intelligence and related technologies, biometric data nowadays can incorporate  cutting-edge features that increases protection and security.
                <p></p>
                Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing individuals based on their physical, behavioral, and physiological attributes such as fingers, face, iris, gait and voice” (p. 1). Currently a great deal of research is focused on designing sophisticated biometrics to enhance identity theft prevention.</p>
